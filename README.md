# PDF Export App

1. Export Functionality: The app integrates with the Froala editor to capture the content (HTML) that the user wants to export as a PDF.
2. Styling and Configuration: Users or administrators configure the app to define how the HTML content should be styled in the PDF. This configuration might include:
   - CSS Styles: Users can provide custom CSS styles or use predefined stylesheets to ensure consistent formatting across both the editor and the generated PDF.
   - Fonts: Specification of fonts that should be used in the PDF to match the editor's display.
   - Page Layout: Settings for page size, margins, headers, footers, and other layout elements to optimize the PDF's appearance.
3. Third-Party Library Integration: The app leverages a third-party library to convert the HTML content into a PDF file. This library interprets the HTML and applies the specified styles and configurations to produce a visually accurate PDF representation.
4. Generating and Delivering PDF: Once the HTML content is processed by the third-party library:
   - The PDF file is generated based on the configured settings.
   - The generated PDF file is sent back to the user's browser as a downloadable file.
   - Users can then save the PDF to their local disk or device.
5. Key Configuration Considerations:
   - Consistency: Ensuring that the styles and formatting in the PDF match as closely as possible to what is displayed in the Froala editor.
   - Responsive Design: Handling responsive content from the editor appropriately in the PDF format.
   - Performance: Optimizing the PDF generation process to handle large or complex documents efficiently.
   - User Options: Providing options for users to customize certain aspects of the PDF export, such as choosing different styles or page settings.
6. User Experience: The goal is to provide a seamless experience where users can easily export their edited content into a professionally formatted PDF without discrepancies between the editor's display and the PDF output.
   In summary, the success of the PDF export app hinges on its ability to faithfully reproduce the content and styling from the Froala editor into a PDF format through careful configuration and integration with appropriate third-party tools.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
